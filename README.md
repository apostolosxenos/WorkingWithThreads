# Working with Java Threads

This project deals with Java Threads and Concurrency. It clearly shows the advantage of using multiple threads in parallel to perform specific calculations. 
A comparison of execution times for different number of threads (1, 2, 4, 8) is provided in the console for each task.

# Task 1

The program fills an array with 2^20 randomly generated passwords. These passwords consist of at least 8 to maximum 16 small and capital letters combined. Each thread runs on a specific part of the array and sums the occurence of each character found in a synchronized way to avoid interference.

# Task 2

# Explanation for all tasks will be added soon...
